This python program takes an amino acid sequence and calculates bond lengths and angles of a protein atoms based on a their atomic position

It uses this equation to calculate the length and angles:

The input must be in a single line 

Example: 

Input: 
C = (39.447, 94.657, 11.824) N = (39.292, 95.716, 11.027) Ca = (39.462, 97.101, 11.465)

Output: 

N-C bond length:1.33

N-Ca bond length:1.46

N-Ca bond angle:124.0
