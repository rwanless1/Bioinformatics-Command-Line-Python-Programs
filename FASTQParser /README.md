This python program takes the FASTQ information from a DNA sequences and parses the Data to make it readable to the user

Example: 

Input: @EAS139:136:FC706VJ:2:2104:15343:197393

Output: 
Instrument = EAS139
Run ID = 136
Flow Cell ID = FC706VJ
Flow Cell Lane = 2
Tile Number = 2104
X-coord = 15343
Y-coord = 197393
