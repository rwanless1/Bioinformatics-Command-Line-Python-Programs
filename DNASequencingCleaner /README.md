This is a simple python program that cleans seqeuncing data from a DNA sequencer 
Often sequences are not able to read nucleotide bases from the DNA being processed.
The programs will denote these unknown bases as 'N'
This program removes and counts theses 'N's 

Example: 

Input:ATTTGNNNCCC

Output: ATTTG{ 3 }CCC
